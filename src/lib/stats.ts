/**
 * Tauri invoke wrappers for the Phase 5 statistics subsystem (05a).
 *
 * Wraps the 2 stats commands wired in 05b:
 *   - `get_playtime_trend(period, days)` — bucketed playtime histogram
 *   - `get_top_games(limit)` — top-N by total_playtime_sec
 *
 * Shape sources of truth:
 *   - `TrendPoint` ↔ `src-tauri/src/commands.rs::TrendPoint`
 *   - `TopGame`    ↔ `src-tauri/src/commands.rs::TopGame`
 *
 * Both Rust structs serialize without `rename_all`, so snake_case is preserved
 * over the wire (matches the convention used in `launch.ts`).
 *
 * Invoke arg convention: snake_case Rust params; we pass camelCase JS keys
 * here and Tauri 2 auto-converts (verified across the existing 03/04 wrappers).
